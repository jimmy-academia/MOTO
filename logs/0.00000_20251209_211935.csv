"Elodie is putting on a fashion show and has five fabulous outfits for her five fabulous fashion models. However, on the day of the show, two of the outfits were ruined in an unfortunate permanent marker incident. Regardless, the show must go on and the remaining outfits will be presented. If each outfit can only be worn by one model and there is no time for any model to wear more than one dress, how many different shows can Elodie put on? (Note: Two shows are considered the same if they contain the same models wearing the same dresses.)","Error:

A turn consists of rolling a standard die and tossing a fair coin. The game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads. What is the probability the game will be won before the fourth turn? Express your answer as a common fraction.,"Error:

","The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3=\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\dfrac{125}{216}=\boxed{\dfrac{91}{216}}$.",0,0.0

","First notice that $a\equiv 8\pmod 9$ tells us that $a\equiv 2\pmod 3$, so once we satisfy the former, we have the latter.    So, we focus on the final three congruences.  We do so by rewriting them as \begin{align*}
a&\equiv -1\pmod 5,\\
a&\equiv -1\pmod 7,\\
a&\equiv -1\pmod 9.
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(5,7)=\gcd(7,9)=\gcd(9,5)=1$, the above congruences apply that $a\equiv -1\pmod{5\cdot 7\cdot 9}$, or $a\equiv 314\pmod{315}$. So $a$ is of the form $314+315n$ for an integer $n$. The smallest non-negative number of this form is $\boxed{314}$, which satisfies the original congruences.",0,0.0
